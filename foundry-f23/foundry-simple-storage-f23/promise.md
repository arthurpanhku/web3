I promise to never use my private key assocaited with real money in plain text.
1. for the moment, a `$PRIVATE_KEY` in my `.env` file is cool.
2. So long as I don't expose the `.env` file.
3. But for the real money, I won't do that. I will use `--interactive` or a keystore file with a password once foundry adds that.
