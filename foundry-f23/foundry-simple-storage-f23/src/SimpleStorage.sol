// This is a comment explaining the contract
// It allows you to store and retrieve a single unsigned integer value.
// The contract is simple and demonstrates basic state management in Solidity.
// The set function allows you to update the stored value,
// while the get function allows you to retrieve the current value.
// The contract is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand for beginners in Solidity programming.
// The contract uses public visibility for the storedData variable,
// which automatically creates a getter function for it.
// The contract is written in Solidity version 0.8.19, which is a stable version of the language.
// The SPDX license identifier at the top indicates that this code is licensed under the
// MIT License, which is a permissive free software license.
// The contract does not include any complex logic or additional features,
// making it suitable for educational purposes and as a starting point for more complex contracts.
// The contract is part of the foundry-f23 project, specifically in the foundry-simple-storage-f23 directory.
// The contract is designed to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain or compatible networks.
// The contract can be tested using Foundry, a popular testing framework for Solidity contracts.
// The contract is simple and does not include any security features,
// so it should not be used in production without further enhancements.
// The contract is a good example for learning about Solidity syntax and basic contract structure.
